Yesterday I figured out how to encrypt blocks in vim, so this is my new
notebook.

Today I haven't done much.  I took client calls and went to the bank to deposit
the Nectar M1 check.  I think in my head that was enough.

Tomorrow I'm hoping to code outside and do some writing about that.

Not a productive day.

### Tuesday, July 12th 2016

Already well into July.  Having trouble / feeling unwilling to work on Montage
client work.  The 'developer experience' on that project is not as good.
Hopefully I can get three hours in and move things along.  I really want to do
32 hours this week to get ready for next week.

Our goal isn't to bill lots of hours, it's to do really amazing stuff, stuff I
can tell my kids about.  Doing business well is interesting as a timeless,
beautiful thing.

Have contract from iHM.  Today was better, productivity-wise, tomorrow I need to

### Wednesday, July 13th 2016

Logged about four billable hours, messing with CSS for Artdrop and building
email functionality for Nectar.  Signed/submitted iHM contract and read more
about contract negotiation.  Bought plane ticket to defcon.  Had dinner with
Max/Zachary and discussed longer term plans which sort of wore me out, putting
those things into spoken work, and makes me want to focus on work and personal
life.

Max's point about wanting things to sort of run themselves / minimizing stress
is a very good one.  Being busy for the sake of 'being busy businessperson' is
sort of silly.

### Thursday, July 14th 2016

Need to make presentation for the ReactCamp thing.  Wish the event was better
organized, seems fishy.  Not exactly sure what should be prioritized today in
terms of client work.

### Monday, July 18th 2016

First day at iHM went well.  Feel satisfied with their technical level and the
coherence of the team.  Both Zachary and I seem a bit ill-adjusted to working in
an office for eight hours straight: found myself 'looking at the clock',
figuratively.

Looking forward to lunch meeting w/ other consultancies, very exciting and
useful.  I draw a lot of energy from people like that.

Bought two nice shirts from opening ceremony.  At bar now (not a bar I like very
much), hopefully will get some work done on Montage.

### Wednesday, July 20th 2016

Met with Screen yesterday.  Very cool to meet a symmetric group of young people
from Taiwan/China who are scheming and dreaming while staying aware of beauty.
Enjoying my new clothing.  Getting well into the feel for the iHM work, still
happy with the team we are working with.  Signing lease for new office today: it
is extremely charming, I think it potentially has the 'quality without a name',
at least from the outside.  Today I will see inside.

Somewhat tired: last night worked on Montage.  Some bug that is based on a shaky
third party service.  Also I am making $40 less an hour on that project.
Hopefully Max will be able to take over the work there soon, it's a codebase he
knows.

### Thursday, July 21st 2016

Last day of first week at iHM.  Moving into new office tomorrow.  Last night
went to a 'super meetup' that included Code Drink Talk Bushwick.  I met Michael
there, he recognized Computer Lab from my name tag.  I really enjoyed talking to
him, he told me a lot of interesting things in an engaging way.  He is 'on
leave' from Thoughtworks.  He is the best example I've met of a developer
working in 'civic engagement'.

### Monday, July 25th 2016

Sort of inefficient day at iHR.  Had dinner with Zachary and Rob, talked about
money, and felt silly and cardboard-like doing so.  Had a nice lunch with
Zachary.  Got paid for Artdrop.  Feel guilty about Montage...should just make
some time, push some commits, that will hold things over until Max comes back.
Dealings with Vice on an iOS app of theirs, ... , seems unprofessional on their
end.  Getting anything done seems to require a lot of professionalism.  I think
I'm focusing too much on client work.  Need to spend more time planning, writing
or doing open source.

### Tuesday, July 26th 2016

Another pretty inefficient day at iHR.  Had to make more changes to past work
based on specs that weren't communicated before build, even after asking.  The
good thing is that it is good practice for working with forks: that requires
another sort of flow that should become habit soon, which will help with my
goals of getting into open source.  Learning the whole Jira/Agile flow is a
whole other thing in itself that is also valuable.  So, the cracks in the
process are starting to show but at least I am learning them.

Feel the need to check back into earlier goals and stuff I feel is important.
Month one of Q3 is nearing a close and there's been decent progress, but I
haven't necessarily been focused on making the goals happen.  And then I also
have (a very short) list of goals outside of the goals for the company.
Basically: writing.   I just looked at the analytics for college memoir:
basically zero except for spikes of referral spam.  Sad!  But okay.

I think the level that will feel good is finding a way to do iHM, goals, AND
other client work.  In that order.  Obviously I want to do other client work for
money and to make them happy, and I will use that motivation to motivate myself
to do the goals.

At defcon.  Excellent.

New works: columnist, comfort zone, cool, facist, publicize.

The definition of privacy is the weakest link in discussions about privacy.

Privacy is a cognitive artifact.

Boundaries

There is no intrinsic right to privacy, intellectual property.

Privacy advocates are fighting a losing rear-guard action against reality.

Determined by the level of abstraction at which you can see.

You are known better than you know yourself.  Because you don't see yourself at
that level of abstraction.

### Sunday, August 21st 2016

It's been a difficult few weeks, but I think things should be better.

I got bedbugs and was seeing things in a very narrow way and felt sort of
trapped, mostly due to not having enough of a personal life.  This will
obviously lead to annoyances.

Rob has been doing an excellent job on the Nectar backend work, would be in huge
trouble if it were not for him.  Over the last two weeks I stopped learning very
much as I focused on getting iHM stuff done, now I think I am reading about
React again.  The Nectar codebase is working great, the composability of the
work done for the previous milestone is amazing.

Feel the need to be more professional, not in a superficial sense, but in a
deeper sense: not making half-baked promises, always trying to make a good deal,
always representing the business well.

Bedbugs and sickness was also not helpful, obviously.  Should go to the dentist
and find a new sports routine.

### Monday, August 22nd 2016

Wrist is definitely in pain.  Not really sure what I can do there.  The only
obvious solution is to stop using the computer.  Maybe I can do that at iHM on
Wednesday.  Need to be responsible there.

Now would be a good time to spend more time reading SICP, or writing by hand.

### Friday, August 26th 2016

Things going better.  Should have Nectar under control by the end of the day.
iHM maybe going better.  Body feels better.

### Friday, September 2nd 2016

Things are much better.  SingleSprout project went very well overall and was
done in time.  Having more fun at iHM.  Good projects incoming.  Everybody seems
engaged and excited.  Checks in the mail.

Oh, and finally figured out a good way to yank in tmux.

### Tuesday, September 13th 2016

I enjoyed reading Stephen Arnott's 'NEET Diary' last night.  This sentence was
my favorite: "The whole idea is that being a NEET is about setting your range of
expectations and basically defining the scope of your world."  Starting a
company, at least the way we've been doing it, feels a lot like being a NEET.  I
think I've experienced many of the same anxieties and pleasures.  There's
something very creative and freeing about it, but also a sense that you are
doing something *wrong*.  'Being a founder' is more socially acceptable way of
being a NEET.  I remember getting lunch with Dan (who actually is a NEET) and
talking with him about how weird it feels to not be either an employer/owner or
employee: the assumption that a person is either an employer or an employee is
baked into all of the accounting software we use, etc.  If one transitions to
being an owner/employer I guess the kinship with NEETs probably evaporates
because then the role is clear again.  But we are not there yet, and may never
get there.  For better or worse.   For better or worse.  My current verbal tic
is 'for better or worse'.

Finally got UltiSnips working.  It was some nonsense.  Unsure of what I should
be working on right now exactly.

### Wednesday, September 14th 2016

I ran into Dina from college on the subway, she's moving to New York to work at
Triple Canopy.  I was on my way to go paint my room in 274 Quincy.  Luckily I
talked on the phone with Mommy before painting and she told me that it would be
bad to use semi-gloss for the walls (I had already bought a bunch of
semi-gloss).

Excellent excellent day at iHM.  Big refactor done by other team member that I
really like and general good atmosphere on the team.  I think things will be
okay.  Will do some writing tonight and I am itching to do some OSS work work
soon.

### Thursday, September 15th 2016

Halfway through September.  It seems like nothing much is coming of my 'three
big plays', though something could come of those actions in the future.  I
definitely feel the urge to bring in some new business.  Talked with Katherine,
which reminded me that Lab has never really 'designed' anything visually,
besides our own site.  It would be great to actually do branding/feel for
someone.  I will find a business opportunity that will let us work with
Katherine or another designer so that we can do a project where we originate the
look and feel as well.  I don't think anyone currently 'in' Computer Lab has the
ability to do that, which is a good reason to grow or find partnerships.  Doing
Tired today, stayed up to about 1:30 talking with Zoe, which is no good for my
wrists.  After staying late at iHM.  Hopefully will finish the painting today.
Hopefully Rob is happy, can't believe the deal with Screen is still not yet
signed.  Annoying.

### Monday, September 19th 2016

The 5k was fun and I feel 'more like myself' after.  In the new iHR office which
has a north view instead of a south view.  Very rainy and grey.  Good weekend,
tired now though.  I hope FC goes well for Rob.

### Tuesday, September 20th 2016

Fell asleep without food after work yesterday, so I didn't do the things I
wanted to: writing, painting, etc.  Also I didn't have any money in my account.
Now I have $7k.  Hopefully this is the last time I 'forget to pay myself'.

Today at iHM I don't have any tickets to work on.  Hopefully I will use the time
well.

Let's see, what else.  Need to write some about my personal life but I can't get
the gpg trick working on OSX.

Looking forward to doing the branding work, and also doing branding work for
clients.  That will be satisfying and cool.  We do need to do some deep, hard
work to define our business plan  We do need to do some deep, hard work to
define our business plan.  It's very ad hoc at this point.  I hope
Max/Zachary/Rob can help push things here.  I believe in the possibility of
having a very good plan of what I want to build and then carrying it out.  We've
been doing that so far, and I think it can continue, but with greater scope.
The questions are: what specifically do you want?  What do you want to see in
the world?  What does the world

What now?

### Monday, September 26th 2016

This weekend was fine.  On Friday, after working out a deal for the branding
with Hello Velocity, I went to a noise show at NYU.  Rob's girlfriend Alyssa was
performing as part of a noise ensemble.  On Saturday I met with Mommy and her
friend, we went to lunch, visited the Computer Lab office, and then went to the
9/11 Memorial (my first time there).  The most notable aspect of the memorial
for me was how you wouldn't see to the bottom of the pits that recycled the
water in the reflecting pools, due the geometry of the pools.  Then I went to
Snowden and a party with the iHM ops people, with Theo.  The two experiences
blended together nicely.  Sunday I didn't do much, the only distinct thing was
going to an art opening based on Christopher Alexander.  Feel pretty tired and
uninterested in coding right now.  I need to finish the writeup for the NYC Wifi
Link Kiosk hack.  Figuring that out was the most fun aspect of the weekend
honestly.  Hacking is deeply fun.  This morning I felt a strong desire to write
well.

Got a bit too much sleep last night.  I fell asleep at 10pm, woke up, talked with
a woman from Tinder on the phone from 2am - 3am (she had a nice voice), watched
a YCombinator Elon Musk interview, went back to sleep.  Talking on the phone was
pretty nice.  The net is vast and infinite.

### Tuesday, September 27th 2016

Presidential debate last night.  Went to my new place after, where there were
two packages full of bedding.  I got the mattress pad around two corners of the
bed, and fell asleep on top of it.  Woke up at 7AM.  Haven't had an easy time
focusing / feeling motivated to code this week.  I think it's partly just
because the tickets are pretty boring, and I'm in more of a design / business
mood.  Hopefully the work next sprint will be more engaging.  Anyways, money is
good.

It turns out that Dina's boyfriend seems to be into literature, that's cool.
They could both become friends.

I do need to work a bit harder.

### Wednesday, September 28th 2016

Fuck, the build is broken.  Feel uninterested.  Got a haircut and feel better
now.  Talking about art.  I'm going to be working on the failed minimalism
piece and the quick review for Celine this week.  Might be moving to new home
this weekend, that'd be nice.  I hope the check comes, I want to go clothes
shopping and work on my image.

Just doing the daily TODO list is big.  I do feel more adult and confident
lately, even though I've been feeling slow.  This morning I was thinking about
the need, at this age, to define oneself relatively to 'other big things', the
world.  I think I'm imagining something like that Doug Engelbart described
himself doing when he was married and twenty-five, fresh from the army: looking
at the problems that the world is facing, and figuring out how they could be
solved.  At twenty-four I think I have a decent idea of my abilities,
weaknesses, risk tolerence, degree of specialness, etc.  School, relationships,
and some crisis have taught me enough about myself that I can see myself
accurately in relation to different problems and opportunities in the world.

I imagine this process can be accomplished pretty quickly.  It's really a matter
of just reading, visiting, and consulting experts.  I can do it with Zachary,
Max, Rob, and others, it doesn't have to be a lonely thing.  From a 'networked
individualistic' perspective, what THEY choose to do has a large effect on what
it makes sense for me to do.  Programming, writing and business are ultimately
pretty general skills.  I think one big thing I can't neglect is my concern for
beauty.

### Thursday, September 29th 2016

'Moved' into 274 Quincy last night, commmuted from there this morning.

### Sunday, October 2nd 2016

Very quiet weekend, I only went out Friday night.  I worked pretty hard to clean
up the new place, and started working on the Lab business plan.  The combination
of the forward-thinking research and the nesting behavior, on these grey
relatively stress-free days, led to a very muted hypomania.  Is it really
hypomania at all if it's totally sustainable and healthy?  There's something a
little sinister about it, but sinister in a seductive, adult way.  I did tweet a
fair amount.  I feel a little bit ashamed.

I think I have a plan for iHM contract renewal.  Need to calmly execute it, it's
a perfectly good plan.  I really do feel much calmer.  It's another one of those
times where I feel much less fucked and like I'll very soon have a loving
girlfriend and all of the good things in the world.

### Monday, October 3rd 2016

Stressors this morning.  Talking with Garret this afternoon, should enact iHM
plan, branding stuff this evening.  My abs feel almost non-existent and I think
I have a paunch.

### Tuesday, October 4th 2016

I'm still not feeling great despite the exciting talk with Garrett, and
reasonably good branding meeting last night.  Feel low-key anxious and body
feels are bad.  I also need to write the Peter Burr thing.

### Wednesday, October 5th 2016

I'm imagining things going like this:

October: iHeart, branding, Screen, Flight Club
November: iHeart, ramp up PHCS, branding, Flight Club, Buffalo
December: wind down iHeart, PHCS, Taipei, planning, design-intensive projects
January: Taiwan,

### Thursday, October 6th

Absolutely need to do something about my body.  I'm thinking Mary is right, I
should join Equinox.  Though I do want to be careful about getting sort of
tranced by bougie stuff.  It wears out pretty quickly.

I think I'm going to join the YMCA in Bed-Stuy.  It's like a block away from
home.  It really is time to be that person in your head.
