Yesterday I figured out how to encrypt blocks in vim, so this is my new
notebook.

Today I haven't done much.  I took client calls and went to the bank to deposit
the Nectar M1 check.  I think in my head that was enough.

Tomorrow I'm hoping to code outside and do some writing about that.

Not a productive day.

### Tuesday, July 12th 2016

Already well into July.  Having trouble / feeling unwilling to work on Montage
client work.  The 'developer experience' on that project is not as good.
Hopefully I can get three hours in and move things along.  I really want to do
32 hours this week to get ready for next week.

Our goal isn't to bill lots of hours, it's to do really amazing stuff, stuff I
can tell my kids about.  Doing business well is interesting as a timeless,
beautiful thing.

Have contract from iHM.  Today was better, productivity-wise, tomorrow I need to 

### Wednesday, July 13th 2016

Logged about four billable hours, messing with CSS for Artdrop and building
email functionality for Nectar.  Signed/submitted iHM contract and read more
about contract negotiation.  Bought plane ticket to defcon.  Had dinner with
Max/Zachary and discussed longer term plans which sort of wore me out, putting
those things into spoken work, and makes me want to focus on work and personal
life.

Max's point about wanting things to sort of run themselves / minimizing stress
is a very good one.  Being busy for the sake of 'being busy businessperson' is
sort of silly.

Need to make presentation for the ReactCamp thing.  Wish the event was better
organized, seems fishy.  Not exactly sure what should be prioritized today in
terms of client work.

### Monday, July 18th 2016

First day at iHM went well.  Feel satisfied with their technical level and the
coherence of the team.  Both Zachary and I seem a bit ill-adjusted to working in
an office for eight hours straight: found myself 'looking at the clock',
figuratively.

Looking forward to lunch meeting w/ other consultancies, very exciting and
useful.  I draw a lot of energy from people like that.  

Bought two nice shirts from opening ceremony.  At bar now (not a bar I like very
much), hopefully will get some work done on Montage.

Met with Screen yesterday.  Very cool to meet a symmetric group of young people
from Taiwan/China who are scheming and dreaming while staying aware of beauty.
Enjoying my new clothing.  Getting well into the feel for the iHM work, still
happy with the team we are working with.  Signing lease for new office today: it
is extremely charming, I think it potentially has the 'quality without a name',
at least from the outside.  Today I will see inside.

Somewhat tired: last night worked on Montage.  Some bug that is based on a shaky
third party service.  Also I am making $40 less an hour on that project.
Hopefully Max will be able to take over the work there soon, it's a codebase he
knows.
