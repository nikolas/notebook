Headline: What is Gray Man Style?

Gray man style is essentially normcore for preppers and survivialists.  The core
idea of Gray Man Style is that in a "shit hits the fan" scenario, you don't want
to stand out, you want to blend in. So while normcore developed a distinctive,
easily identifiable visual langauge (dad jeans and ...), gray man style is only
successful when it's not identifiable, and always context-dependent.  One key
aspect of gray man style is that it's intensely utilitarian. The notion of the
gray man was developed largely by white male preppers who as a response to a
fantasy urban survival scenario. SurvivialThinkTank.com defines a 'gray man' as
'an individual who possesses the skills, ability and intent to blend into any
situation or surrounding without standing out, concealing his or her true
skills, ability, and intent from others.' This idea could be applied to
individuals besides survivalists. It may be desireable in certain situations to
someone with true skills, ability, and intent, to conceal their true nature. In
other situations, it might be desireable to clearly signal those abilities and
intentions, to inspire solidarity, identity or prevent confusion. The idea of
gray man style includes the notion of different 'phases':

Therefore grey man clothing is often 'transformable' in some way, in order to
swtich between contexts.
