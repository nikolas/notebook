Headline: How to Access Your Full Electronic Health Record

Subhead: How to get a copy of your comprehensive health data, and see what
companies and organizations have been accessing that data.

By law, every American has the right to access their own complete electronic
health record, and do what they want with it. In this piece, I'll investigate
whether people can practically exercise this right. I'll also discuss how health
providers monetize the EHRs of their patients, often without the patient's
knowledge. Both of these issues are relevant to the question of whether it's
always in a patient's best interest to disclose certain information to their
healthcare providers, and what a individual can do to ensure control over their
own health information.


Do I have the right to receive a notice that tells me how my health information
is being used and shared?

Yes. You can learn how your health information is used and shared by your
provider or health insurer. They must give you a notice that tells you how they
legally may use and share your health information and how you can exercise your
rights. In most cases, you should get this notice on your first visit to a
provider or in the mail from your health plan, and you can ask for a copy at any
time. This is the document that providers often ask for you to sign to indicate
that you have received it.
