Pitch: How to Get Your Electronic Health Record

By law, every American has the right to access their own complete electronic
health record, and do what they want with it. In this piece, I'll investigate
whether people can practically exercise this right. I'll also discuss how health
providers monetize the EHRs of their patients, often without the patient's
knowledge. Both of these issues are relevant to the question of whether it's
always in a patient's best interest to disclose certain information to their
healthcare providers, and what a individual can do to ensure control over their
own health information.
