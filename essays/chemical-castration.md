Pitch: Sexually Frustrated? Consider Chemically Castrating Yourself

Headline: Sexually Frustrated? Consider Chemically Castrating Yourself

I explain why more men should consider chemically castrating themselves through
use of FDA-approved drugs like Depo-Provera, even if they aren't sex offenders.
I review the benefits of castration, and the often-overlooked historical role
of eunuchs. The piece includes interviews with invdividuals who have been
chemically castrated, and the potential for doctors to guide their patients
through the process.

Proposed deadline: September 20th
