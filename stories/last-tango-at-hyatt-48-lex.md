# Last Tango at Hyatt 48 Lex

Emily seemed impressed with the hotel room.  It was a summer evening in
Manhattan, and the room felt like an airport lounge, with floor to ceiling
windows and a minimalist sofa.  Emily sat on the bed, smiling at Drew.

"Let's have a drink before dinner," said Drew. "Transition."

Emily and Drew had met on the Internet.  After a few months, they decided to
meet in New York, where Drew was working as an intern.  "It's so good to see
you!" Emily had said, as they hugged in Penn Station.

After vodka and orange juice, they got a taxi to Columbus Circle.

"I googled 'restaurants with best view'," said Drew.  "We're going to a place
called *Asiate*, in the Mandarin Oriental."

"Seems relevant to my praxis," said Emily, and laughed.  It was getting dark.

Inside *Asiate* there were many reflective black and gold
surfaces, some a little smudged.

They went for a walk after dinner, stopping in front of a department store.
They were both a little tipsy.  Emily got up on her toes and kissed Drew.

On Monday morning, Drew went to midtown for the last day of his internship.

"I feel like a hotel wife," Emily texted.

Drew's boss took him to breakfast at the Four Seasons, and unexpectedly told
Drew that he was quitting and going to a startup.  "It's an opportunity to
create some wealth for my family," he said.

There was scattered rain.  The next afternoon Emily would fly back to LA, and
Drew would drive home to Cleveland.

Emily didn't want to go out to dinner.  Neither did Drew, really.  Emily kept
rubbing her nose in short bursts, packing her bags for the next day.

"Are you okay?" asked Drew.

"I just feel like," Emily said, agitated, "that to you, I'm just an experience."

Drew thought back to the last person, who called him a psychopath. He wanted
Emily to tell him exactly how he bothered her, so that he could change.

She shook her head *no*, with tears in her eyes.

"I'm going to go exercise," said Drew, and went down to the hotel gym.  He didn't
have running shoes, so he ran barefoot until the treadmill ripped skin from his
toes.  Then he went back up to the room for a shower.

After getting dressed, he sat down on the side of the bed.

"I have a whole list of things to say," said Drew.

"Okay.  Write it down," said Emily.

"I want to say them...don't say anything while I say them or I'll never finish."

Emily said "okay" and let him talk.  His list didn't make much sense, she
thought.  She could tell that a part of it was quoted from his notebook.

Emily lay in bed feeling confused and a bit bored.  She thought about her ex,
Nathaniel.  He was in his thirties.  He once yelled at her for writing at
his kitchen table, because it was made of unfinished wood.  She started to cry,
breathing through her mouth.

Drew finished talking.  He felt a bit better.

They went downstairs so Emily could smoke.  Emily and Drew were both starting to
get exasperated.

"I'm just not deeply in love with you!" Drew finally said, pacing around a
granite bench.

"I'm not deeply in love with you either!" said Emily, and they both grinned.

"This is really good!" said Emily.

The next morning, they spent a while in bed, talking about the night before.
