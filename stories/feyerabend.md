# Feyerabend

Feyerabend's driver slowed the car to a crawl, trying to find her address on the
dark street.  Feyerabend was very conscious of the sounds of the hot vehicle and
her own small movements.

They stopped in front an academic-looking building, set back in a stand of oak
trees.  The driver showed Feyerabend around her new apartment, struggling to
explain obvious things about the fixtures. Feyerabend felt stunned by the quiet
when he left.

<hr>

The next day was warm and summery.  Feyerabend decided to go to a nearby outdoor
swimming park.  She was supposed to spend her first week in Warsaw 'getting
situated', not working.  Feyerabend sat on a towel in the bristly green grass,
reading a novel from the airport.

The afternoon passed quickly.  She watched families grilling and jumping in the
pool, and thought ahead to meeting people at the lab on Monday.  It would
probably be okay: Feyerabend was used to meeting colleagues from the Internet.
There would be a lot to talk about.

<hr>

Feyerabend felt like she was in high school, on summer vacation.  She was used
to being almost perfectly focused, trying to learn everything she could about
her chosen passion, formal grammar.  She had spent ten years of her life in
universities, focused.  When her classmates went out to jobs, they had always
treated her with a bit of pity, asking questions like "what type of applications
do you see for your work?"

When Feyerabend finally left academia and got a job, she put most of her effort
into independent research and correspondence.  She got involved with the direct
semantic IO project, submitting the more RFCs than anyone else.

Just a few weeks after starting work at a machine learning company, she recieved
an email from Addision Chen, inviting her to work on direct semantic IO in
Warsaw.  It was the happiest moment of Feyerabend's life.  She sent a letter of
resignation minutes later.

It was a validation of her serious way of life, her dry, unsparing focus.  She
knew that the semantic IO project was important, and that she had made valuable
contributions.  And now she was taking a irrevocable step forward.  She had done
something for the world, and no one could take that fact away from her.

<hr>

Feyerabend's driver was waiting outside of her apartment on Monday morning.  She
fell asleep in the car, startling on arrival.

Feyerabend was shown to her new office, a room at the end of a drab hallway in a
glass atrium.  There was a bookshelf, a coffee table, and a set of excellent
digital windows.  Feyerabend spent a few minutes organizing her things.

Someone pushed open the door, and stuck in their head.

"Leah?" the person said.  He had a French accent.

"Hello," said Feyerabend, standing up.

The person introduced himself as a fellow researcher, and suggested that they go
find a conference room.

The researcher said that he mostly worked on the project's hardware, but that he
had read Feyerabend's proposals, and thought they were very well-considered.

"Thanks," said Feyerabend.

"Do you have any insight into whether I'll be involved with the hardware aspect
of the project?" she asked.

"Well, you'll be working with the hardware almost constantly, that's why you're
here."

"It's not an area I have much expertise in," said Feyerabend, smiling.

"We've developed a fairly straightforward user interface for the CBI.  I'll be
interested in your feedback."

"Definitely, yeah," said Feyerabend.

"Why don't we go take a look at it?"

"The CBI device?  Now?"

"Sure," said the French researcher.  "There's some safety training you'll need
to do before you actually use it, but we can take a look."

Feyerabend was very excited to work with a real medical-grade computer-brain
interface.  She had experience with transcranial magnetic stimulation devices,
and an Internet friend had once shown her a focused ultrasound effector, but the
project's hardware opened up a whole new realm of possibilities.

"Here it is!" said the French researcher, opening an unmarked door.  "We have a
few others, but this is the latest iteration."

The room contained a hacked-open MRI sled, stripped of the usual white medical
plastic. The focused ultrasound transducers were mounted on the inside of the
MRI tube, with copper wires leading to a server closet.

The researcher gave her a quick tour of the machine's components.  Feyerabend
struggled to not complete his sentences.  As the researcher was showing
Feyerabend the improvements he had developed, a middle-aged woman came into the
room, saying "hello!" loudly to announce herself.

"Leah, meet Addison," said the French researcher.

"Wow," said Feyerabend, shaking Addison's hand lightly.  "Great to meet to you
in person, finally."

Feyerabend recognized that Addison was attractive, something she had not
expected.  She was surprised at how starstruck she felt.

Addision quickly outlined a plan for the next few weeks, a plan that would
onboard Feyerabend, and get her working effectively with the CBI.


<hr>

That evening, Feyerabend treated herself to a celebratory meal at a restaurant
near her apartment.  Work seemed so perfect.  She would have the whole next week
to experiment with the CBI, under the supervision of Addison.

As Feyerabend waited for her food, she used her phone to sign up for things:
fitness classes, a few expat meetup groups, a recurring vacation week, and
automated bill payments.  It was hard to imagine ever being unhappy again.

<hr>

Feyerabend brought a notebook to the CBI room the next morning.  Addison arrived
moments later.

"Ready?" said Addison.

"Yup."

"Okay.  I think Eric already has everything up and running.  Do you mind getting
into the calibration pose for me?"

The inside of the new MRI scanner was almost silent.

"Okay.  Here we go," said Addison's voice, from a speaker somewhere.
Feyerabend's heart was racing.

"We'll start with a test pulse...now."

Feyerabend experienced something entirely new.

"What was that?" laughed Feyerabend, knowing exactly what it was.  So it worked!
Of course it did.

"A qualia!" said Addison, also laughing.  "Weird, right?"

What had Feyerabend just experienced?   It was something totally abstract: it
didn't remind her of anything.

It was just there, and distinct.  The only thing that seemed comparable, in
terms of novelty, was when she had experienced her first orgasm around the age
of thirteen.  But this was a much quieter, more precise feeling, without
pleasure or *anything*, really.

"Okay, okay, let's call that one '0', just for fun," said Addision.  "Here comes
'1'."

Feyerabend felt an entirely different quiet little thing.

"Wow," said Feyerabend.  "Got it."

"And '0' again."

"Got it," said Feyerabend.  There was no question of confusing the two qualia.

Addison slowly transmitted a binary sequence of qualia encoding the ASCII
characters for 'HI'.

Feyerabend laughed gleefully.

<hr>

According to the French researcher, the focused ultrasound effector was capable
of producing at least a million different qualia, consistently, thousands of
times a second.

At lunch in the cafeteria, Addison explained that Feyerabend had the authority
to develop a useful set of symbol groundings for the qualia, so that they could
be used as a language, a direct semantic communication channel between the
computer and brain.  Feyerabend had proposed a number of different hypothetical
languages of this type on the Internet, langauges not limited by human sight or
hearing, languages of pure meaning.

"I'd love to tell you that this will just be a prototype, but my feeling is that
whatever you develop, it will be widely adopted.  I think you should try to
create a system with strong conceptual clarity and extensibility.  Does that
make sense to you?"

"Yes."

<hr>

The first thing Feyerabend developed was a set of qualia that could be used to
describe the formal structure of any language: words related to grammar, syntax,
and morphology.  A remote team of programmers helped her develop a training
program, a virtual assistant that taught users to associate specific qualia with
the concepts that Feyerabend chose.

Feyerabend was then able to partially describe her plans for the qualia language
using qualia.  After spending a few hours in the MRI tube with the training
program, the other researchers could rapidly recieve a concise, up-to-date
outline of Feyerabend's language, in the form of a stream of qualia.

It worked.

Feyerabend limited herself to nine hour workdays.  She spent most of her time
inside of the MRI machine, thinking, and vocally telling the computer to store
her ideas as qualia codepoints.

<hr>

When Feyerabend completed the meta-language around Christmas, the project
started to feel silly.

Feyerabend began to develop a set of "qualia radicals", meant to span human
experience and allow for almost limitless expansion.  The symbols referring to
morphological combination could be directly used with other radicals to create
new meaning.  She didn't have to worry about creating an overly verbose
language: the bandwidth and intuitive nature of the CBI machine allowed the
listener to quickly comprehend long sequences of qualia.

It felt like she was developing some sort of child-like picture language, with a
naive word for everything.

Progress came to a rapid halt, as the team spent hours in meetings trying to
precisely describe the work they needed to do.

One of Feyerabend's articles of faith was that there was success in smallness.
Modesty and simplicity had worked well for her and the language.  But extending
the qualia language to the real world would be messy.  She felt inadequate.

Addison finally rescued her, interrupting a meeting that had dragged on past
sunset.

"Okay, let's be real here, okay?" said Addison.  "What we're trying to do is
crazy ambitious.  But let's talk about it."

"What is this program going to look like?  We need to get people to associate
*things*, like, *trees*, with an arbitrary qualia.  What are we going to do?
Show them a picture of a tree and then fire the qualia?  That's basically how it
works now, right?"

There was a contemplative silence.

"Look, whatever we do, it's not going to be precise, or clean, or recursive.  We
need to map the world onto a sixteen-bit codepoint plane.  It's going to get
messy."

Addison helped Feyerabend pick out a few programmers, and invited them to
Warsaw.  Feyerabend set them up in their own room, and told them to build
whatever they thought would work.

The programmers did drugs, stayed up late, and played a lot in virtual reality.
But progress started to happen.  A number of special displays, speakers, and
experimental inputs were mounted inside the MRI.  It looked ugly.

Feyerabend used herself as the test subject.

The first thing symbol they grounded was trees, a nod to Addison.  Videos,
scents, images of trees.  Feyerabend thought back to the trees in her backyard
growing up, abstract syntax trees, catalogues of trees.  Trees.

The ocean.  Lake.  Void.  Heaven.  Heaven was rendered as some Christian thing,
incense.  More concepts.  Then the whole cycle again.

<hr>

It worked.  After a week with the training program, Feyerabend could reliably
associate 256 qualia radicals with her own private version of each concept.
Real world, concrete concepts.

Over the weekend, the programmers encoded qualia sequences for every bombastic,
primitive thing they could find: the book of Genesis, songs by Rush, poems by
Rumi.  On Monday morning, Feyerabend listened to them all, and cried.

"Guys, it's really amazing," she said.  "I took me like a minute to take it all
in.  There isn't much yet, but it's so clear.  I wish you could try it out now."

<hr>

Feyerabend broke her nine hour workday disciple.  She was spending almost every
waking minute either working, or getting ready for work.  Some nights she slept
in the MRI machine.  It was affecting her.  Now, besides her thoughts and
emotions, there was this third new voice, a quiet fast whisper, the voice of the
computer.

<hr>

It was summer again.  To celebrate, the Warsaw project team took a trip to the
ocean.  During the day, the team avoided the beach, only leaving the guest house
to get watermelon juice at a roadside stand.  Feyerabend ordered for the team in
Polish.  Waves of heat rose from the thousands of bodies on the beach.
Feyerabend spent the day on the ground floor of the house, reading a book in a
wicker chair.

It felt good to be on vacation.

Right before sunset, Addison invited Feyerabend for a walk down the beach.  It
was now empty except for a group of art students photographing their friend.

Feyerabend and Addison took off their sandals, and walked through the surf.
Feyerabend's heart sung as seawater rushed under her feet.

Addision was talking about the paper they were working on.  It described the
successful use of the training program with outside volunteers, who were now
able to receive information from the machine almost instantly, like Feyerabend.

The paper would show that the CBI users were able to perform knowledge-worker
tasks much faster than peers who did not have access to the CBI device.

It would be a landmark paper.

"We can easily have it done by the end of the summer, I think, and present at
the ACM conference this fall," said Addison.

Feyerabend was quiet.  It was obvious that Addison was saying this in
celebration, not looking for feedback.

"I can't thank you enough, Leah," said Addison, after a minute.

Feyerabend remained silent.  She felt unable to speak.  She often had this
feeling after a few hours of focused work on the computer.

"Leah, are you okay?  You've done...so much."

"I'm just tired," said Feyerabend.

Addison stopped walking, and grabbed Feyerabend's arm.  Addison no longer had
the demeanor of an effective, social dentist, but looked more liked a confused
student staring at a problem on a whiteboard.

"We've been working together for what, three years, in various forms?  Online.
Right?" said Addison.

"Yeah," said Leah.

"So, I just want you to know that you can talk to me about whatever you want.
We're your support network, here."

"Thanks," said Feyerabend.  She made sure to make eye contact with Addison.

"I really appreciate that," Feyerabend said.

Back in her room at the guest house, Feyerabend felt lonely.  She
knew that she had the option of drinking and playing cards with her colleagues
downstairs, but decided against it, and got in bed.

She comforted herself with the fact that in her old age, it would probably be
possible to fall fully and deeply in love with a computer program.  She did
deserve love, she knew.  She fell asleep listening to the sound of waves,
thinking about Addison Chen.
