People forcing themselves to read because they want to become a successful
writer...feel like a lot of the world works this way

It seems like most businesses are out here "practicing", in fact it seems like
most of our clients are other businesses just "practicing"

Sometimes I think "why are you so fucking skittish around other people
sometimes?", but then I remember being beaten unconscious on a schoolbus in
elementary school, and feel better 

In 2013 I experienced a renewed hopefulness about my sexuality that felt like
discovering a secret room in the basement of my childhood home

My roommate went to Japan, a place where the economy hasn't really grown in a
generation, this made me question some of the assumptions underlying my life
plan

Money is given or taken, not earned

I've heard it said that "most art wealth in New York City is actually real
estate wealth"

A big assumption right now is that if you play a bit fast, a bit loose, things
will work out in the end
