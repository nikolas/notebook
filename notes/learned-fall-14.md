things learned in school, fall '14:
- finally memorized n choose c, vector cross products, bayes formula, and
  cramer's method
- realistic shading without extremely high triangle counts is achieved by
  mapping a 2d (u,v) parametric function of surface normals, displacement,
  color, reflectance, etc, to 3d geometry
- pretty much any "document" can be effectively modeled as a feature vector,
  normalized, and compared with other "document" vectors by using dot products
  in a high dimensional space, producing a similarity metric ("angle")
- sysout-control-space autocompletes to System.out.println(); in eclipse
- you can linear interpolate just about anything but rotations, and you
  interpolate rotations using quaternions
- the same reasons we often represent directions in 3-space using normalized
  (x,y,z) vectors even though we can use (phi, theta) just fine, we use
  normalized (w,x,y,z) quaternions to represent rotations in 3-space instead of
  euler angles
- a speech will take (4/3) * x minutes to deliver, where x is the number of
  minutes you think it will take to deliver
- recursion isn't magic, you can trace the execution if you aren't a lazy
- information cascades can occur *because* agents are rational
