Drug Feelings Are Real Feelings is a double-edged sword
I need a haircut
Sober?  
PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN AND AWAY
or you will be unhappy and waste time

Making yourself more alone...for the sake of...being true to yourself?  Seems like a risky move right now.


    
RE-ITERATING A DRAFT OF YOUR HIEARCHY OF IMPORTANCE: 
1. Non-Selfish Ideals (Helping People Live Better Lives)
2. Health and Loved Ones (Keeping Yourself and Your "Family" Safe)
3. Selfish Ideals (Self-Actualization, Living The Dream)
4. Friends and Social Life
5. Wealth
6. Comfort



Question with Isabel is not so hard...is she a Loved One.
You don't know what love is I guess.
Is this how you end up like your grandfather though?
Actually avoiding insufferable situations.





what is love, if it can come and go...
if love and family, are, honest to god
the second most important things to you

until I am hit by a love that makes
the first and third most important things
compatible or dovetailed or destroyed

you'll have to take the love I can give
because that's all there is






gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay



IDEAS FOR NON-SELFISH IDEALS:
free and open source software (and other IP)
feminism
reducing waste
destroying racism and trying to fix/atone for what it caused
creating good jobs in places like buffalo
vague but sincere and effective effort to help those I am in contact if they need it and not turn a blind eye
