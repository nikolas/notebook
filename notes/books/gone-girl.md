# Gone Girl

"I remember us ambling around almost a full year ago, pointing at things and
reading placards and saying, 'That's interesting,' while the other one agreed,
'That is.'"

"We were literally experiencing the end of a way of life,"

"I could hear a clattering of dress shoes coming from the back of the house to
the front, and the door opened with a desuctioning sound, like a refrigerator.
Cold air rolled out towards me."
