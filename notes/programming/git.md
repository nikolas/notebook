# Git and GitHub

`git cherry-pick <commit>` applies another commit, even if it's on another
branch or whatever.

`git push origin :<branch>` deletes a remote branch.

`git reset HEAD~` uncommits the most recent commit so that it can be broken
apart, etc

`git update-index --assume-unchanged path/to/file`
