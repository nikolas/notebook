# C# Notes

### Keyword Modifiers
- 'virtual' modifies a method, property, indexer, or event declaration and 
allows for it to be overridden in a derived class
- must use the `override` keyword in the inheriting class
- cannot use virtual keyword on static property
- `readonly` is a modifier than you can use on fields, to ensure declaration 
only occurs as part of the declaration or the constructor
- `sealed` prevents inheritance
